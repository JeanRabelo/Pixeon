## About The Project

The project was made using Flask as the python framework.

There are 3 groups of routes:
-  Traditional routes for info (/exams, /physicians, /patients, /orders)
- Route for making a simple and direct SQL query to the database (/query)
- Route for status checking (/status)

There are some images below that ilustrate the usage of the first 2 (the third one is intuitive):
